# prob_ra
random assignment function to handle complete assignment for non uniform probabilities and blocks

the function can:

* implement a form of complete random assignment with heterogeneous probabilities: for instance to assign exactly 1 out of 2 units to treatment with specified non unifrom probabilities, e.g. (.6, .4)
* implement a form of complete random assignment with "load balancing" across blocks: for instance when there are 3 units in each of 2 blocks and exactly 3 have to be assigned to treatment
